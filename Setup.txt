Email: alexanderosias123@gmail.com
Pass: 12345678

To add sample user, just query this:
INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES ('your-email', 'your-hashed-password');

To know your hashed pashword, just edit the hash_password.php "$password" value then access it with this link: http://localhost/hash_password.php to get your hashed password. 
( "hash_password.php" will be deleted after implementing settings/users page. )
